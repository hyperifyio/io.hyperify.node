Copyright © 2024 Heusala Group Ltd <info@hg.fi>

### 1. Scope of License

This license grants you the right to use, modify, and distribute the software 
solely for non-commercial and evaluation purposes for a period of two (2) years 
from the date of each software release distributed under this license ('Release 
Date'). After this two-year period, the terms of this license will automatically 
transition to the MIT License, allowing for broader usage rights, including 
commercial use. However, notwithstanding any other provisions of this license, 
Heusala Group Ltd (hereinafter referred to as 'HG') and any entities owning a 
part of it, including but not limited to individual owners and business entities, 
are granted the right to use the software for commercial purposes at any time 
without requiring additional permission from HG. 'Non-commercial use' is defined 
as using the software in a manner that is not intended for or directed towards 
commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

For the avoidance of doubt, examples of 'non-commercial use' include, but are 
not limited to:

* ***Educational Purposes:*** Use in an educational environment, such as a school, 
  university, or online educational course, where the primary aim is learning 
  and not generating profit.
* ***Research Activities:*** Use in a research project by a non-profit organization, 
  where the results are intended for public dissemination and not for 
  commercializing or patenting purposes.
* ***Personal Projects:*** Use in personal or hobbyist projects that are not intended 
  to generate revenue or profits.
* ***Charitable Organizations:*** Use by non-profit or charitable organizations that 
  do not engage in commercial activities or generate revenue from the software.
* ***For National Military Purposes:*** The use of the software for national defense 
  purposes by a military organization is permitted, provided that the 
  organization is an ally of Finland. This use is allowed under the assumption 
  that it supports national security and defense objectives in alignment with 
  Finnish foreign policy and international alliances.

Conversely, activities that would not fall under 'non-commercial use' include, 
but are not limited to:

* ***Start-up Development:*** Use in the development of prototypes or foundational 
  technology for a start-up business.
* ***Commercial Research:*** Use in research and development where the results are 
  intended for commercial application, such as developing a commercial product 
  or service.
* ***Revenue-Generating Activities:*** Any use that directly contributes to generating 
  revenue or profit, such as incorporating the software into a commercial 
  product, using it to provide commercial services, or using it in the 
  operations of a business enterprise.
* ***Consultation Services for Third Parties:*** It is not permitted to use the 
  software to provide consultation services where the software is installed on 
  systems of a third party, or where the consultation services are paid and 
  aimed at assisting non-profit purposes. This includes any form of commercial 
  consultancy or paid support where the software forms a core part of the 
  service offered.

### 2. Restriction Period

This license is valid for a period of two (2) years from the date of each 
software release distributed under this license ('Release Date'). For each 
release of the software ('Software Release'), the Restriction Period commences
on its respective Release Date and lasts for two years from that date. During 
the Restriction Period for each Software Release, the use of that particular 
release for commercial purposes is expressly prohibited without written 
permission from HG. Such permission may be granted under a 
separate commercial agreement. Each Software Release is subject to its 
individual Restriction Period as defined herein.

### 3. Transition to MIT License

Upon the expiration of the Restriction Period, the terms of this license will
automatically transition to the MIT License, as detailed below. From that point
forward, the software may be used for any purpose, including commercial use, in
accordance with the terms of the MIT License.

### 4. Compliance and Enforcement

Failure to comply with the terms of this license may result in legal action and
the termination of the license granted herein. The copyright owner reserves the
right to enforce the terms of this license to the fullest extent permitted by
law.

### 5. Disclaimer of Warranty

The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or
implied. The copyright owner makes no warranties regarding the software and
disclaims all liability for damages resulting from its use to the maximum
extent permitted by law.

### 6. Non-Competing Activity

The licensee agrees not to use the software in any manner that directly competes
with the business interests, products, or services of HG. This 
includes, but is not limited to, developing, marketing, or distributing software 
or services that are substantially similar in function, features, or purpose to
those offered by HG. This non-compete clause is valid during the
Restriction Period and continues to apply for one (1) year following the end of
the Restriction Period for each Software Release.

### 7. Governing Law

This license and the use of the software shall be governed by the laws of Finland.
